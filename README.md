# Welcome to my repository!

# Overview
#
This is a repository containing work from Jeffrey (Alias: TheForgotten5). All changes and pull requests are welcome, but they will be reviewed and approved by me before merging.

The repository contains projects created from languages such as C/C++, C#, Java, and Julia. The substantial projects in this repository are the Shogi game, English-Klingon Translator and the Bank Simulation Application. 

# Shogi Game
The Shogi Game application is created in Julia, and implements a complete game of Shogi as defined by its current rules. In this game, players will play against an AI, which is also created in Julia, and can be found under the ProcessSimulator branch of this repository.

# English-Klingon Translator
The English-Klingon Translator is created in C++. The program runs within a Windows Command Prompt window, taking incoming queries in Console Input, and outputs the Klingon translation in Console Output.

# Bank Simulation Application
The Bank Simulation Application is created in C++, and simulates a queue system that separates customer requests. Requests are separated and placed into a queue depending on the customer's time of arrival.

More projects will be added in the future.
